# Idiom detection

Idiom detection is performed by two methods: our Lemmatization approach and the DISC model.

## Lemmatization approach

Our lemmatization approach is described in out paper.

## DISC

The DISC model is suitable for sequence labelling. The original repository can be found on [github](https://github.com/zzeng13/DISC). The added files for this project are `disc_idiom_finder.py` and `idioment_eval.ipynb`.
