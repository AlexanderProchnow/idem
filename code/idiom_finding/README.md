# Idiom detection

Idiom detection is performed by two methods: our Lemmatization approach and the DISC model.

## Lemmatization approach

Our lemmatization approach is described in our paper.

## DISC

The DISC model is suitable for sequence labelling. The original repository can be found on [github](https://github.com/zzeng13/DISC). The added files for this project are `rule_based_finder.py`, `disc_idiom_finder.py` and `hybrid_finder.py`.
